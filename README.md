PROBLEM STATEMENT:-->
With the increasing digitalization and online transactions, it becomes ever so important for the credit card companies to be able to recognize "genuine" and "fraudulent" trans-actions in order to provide their customers with a more secure and a seamless experience.

1. Detect fraudulent transactions at the shortest possible time (Since the transactions are happening in real time, timing constraints play a very important role). Whenever a card member swipes his/her card for payment, the transaction should be classified as fraudulent /authentic based on a set of predefined rules.
2. To resolve the customer complaints and queries, the support team should be made available with the latest customer details (by constantly keeping them updated).
